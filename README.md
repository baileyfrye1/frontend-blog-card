## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a lot of fun and was great practice with taking a Figma file and being able to code it as close to pixel perfect as possible. I was able to build this without the use of media queries just using clamp functions to create more responsive font sizes as well as widths.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing using the clamp function as I feel like I still am guessing some on the actual value that I want. Being able to create responsive designs without the use of media queries is extremely helpful and I believe creates a more fluid user experience.
